Opportunistic ideas include gold miners, US tech, pharma, utilities, India large and mid-cap, China non-financial high-dividend entities, Hang Seng Technology index, Europe banks, US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, short-duration high-yield bonds, AAA-rated Collateralized Loan Obligations, and Asian investment-grade bonds. The outlook anticipates risky assets to outperform in 2026 due to an AI boom, easing fiscal and monetary policies, and abating trade tensions. Themes include equities, income, and diversifiers. Risks include disappointment with Artificial Intelligence, contagious credit event, a Fed policy reversal, or a hawkish BoJ."

      "summary": "The text outlines the investment outlook for various asset classes as of 2026, according to Standard Chartered's Global Investment Committee. USD cash is expected to have falling yields and underperform major asset classes. Bonds, particularly high-quality government and corporate bonds, offer yield benefits but come with risks such as inflation sensitivity and elevated valuations. Emerging market bonds and currencies, Asia USD, and gold are attractive due to lower US rates, central bank rate cuts, and falling real yields, but come with risks like US trade policy. Equities in North America, Europe ex-UK, and Asia ex-Japan are expected to see earnings growth and policy support, but face challenges from valuations, US policy uncertainty, and growth concerns. Private assets and hedge fund strategies are suggested as portfolio hedges with illiquidity premiums, but come with risks of unexpected growth or credit quality worsening and high manager dispersion. The figure shows the performance of Standard Chartered's Foundation Allocations for the 12-month, 3-month, and 1-month periods ending December 2025."

      "summary": "The text discusses the expectation of a weak USD in 2026, with a potential dip below 7.00 in USD/CNH. The USD's recovery since September has weakened due to soft US labor market data and anticipated Fed rate cuts. While a modest rebound is expected in the short term, long-term USD depreciation is anticipated due to Fed rate cuts supporting a cooling job market and reducing the USD's yield advantage. Major currencies, such as the JPY and EUR, are expected to appreciate against the USD. Chinese policymakers may allow USD/CNH to dip below 7.00 but are likely to intervene to defend key levels, with the pair expected to move to 7.02 in three months and stabilize around 7.00 in 12 months. The Fed is predicted to cut rates more than its DM peers."

However, improved valuations, earnings recovery driven by policy measures, and under-investment by foreign investors indicate a potential turnaround in 2026, leading to an upgrade of Indian equities to an Overweight within Asia ex-Japan, with a short-term bullish opportunity."

      "summary": "In Outlook 2026, it is predicted that the US economy will experience a soft landing, growing below its long-term trend of 1.8% but avoiding a recession in 2026. Drivers of this view include easing trade tensions, Fed rate cuts, tax incentives, and AI developments. Consumption is resilient due to high-income households and limited impact of tariffs on goods inflation. The Fed is expected to continue rate cuts, and a weaker USD will further ease financial conditions. Trade tensions are easing with trade deals and a Supreme Court decision on tariffs pending. Tax cuts and the latest budget have given significant benefits to businesses and individuals, with a positive impact on GDP, and the Fed is projected to cut rates by 75bps to 3.0% by the end of 2026."

      "summary": "Outlook 2026 suggests an Overweight position on EM USD and LCY government bonds due to their high nominal yields and improved external balance of EM economies. The Fed's expected monetary policy easing and weak USD should benefit EM debt servicing. DM IG government bonds are recommended as a core holding, with yields expected to fall as the Fed cuts rates, resulting in strong total returns. Rates volatility is anticipated, but brief, and US 10-year government bond yields above 4.25% are seen as attractive. Asia USD bonds also offer attractive yields due to Chinese policy stimulus."

Asia ex-Japan equities are also Overweighted, with benefits from a weaker USD, de-escalating trade tensions, and compelling valuations, particularly in India, where signs of a turnaround are emerging due to ongoing fiscal measures and robust domestic growth. Key risks include sentiment towards AI-related stocks and tariff risks in Asia ex-Japan."

Regulatory uncertainty in the US healthcare sector receded in Q3 2025, leading to a rebound. European financials are Overweight due to attractive valuations and fiscal stimulus, while US financials are more expensive but benefit from deregulation and a soft-landing. China financials remain inexpensive due to exposure to risks."

      "summary": "The text discusses the impact of inflation on the correlation between equities and bonds, suggesting that at higher inflation levels, the correlation between the two increases. This means that a traditional 60:40 equity bond portfolio may be less effective at managing portfolio volatility, leading to an increased incentive for investors to allocate up to 30% of their portfolio to non-traditional asset classes like alternatives. The figure provided illustrates the suggested asset allocation pie charts across different risk profiles, with a decrease in equity and fixed income allocations and an increase in alternatives as inflation rises."

However, over a 12-month horizon, the USD is expected to weaken towards 96, as the Fed eases policy while other major central banks approach the end of their rate-cut cycles. Key charts indicate USD consolidation in the short term and weakness in the long term against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. Political and institutional uncertainties, such as US trade policy and Fed independence, also weigh on the USD."

      "summary": "The text provides currency forecasts and drivers for EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD for the year 2026. The Euro is expected to depreciate slightly against the US Dollar in the near term due to subdued Euro area growth, but the ECB's interest rate hold and Germany's investment plan should boost the Euro over the next 12 months. The British Pound is under pressure from soft UK growth and cautious BoE guidance, but investor confidence and stabilizing fiscal policy could lift the GBP over the next year. The USD/JPY pair is expected to consolidate around 155 near term but decline in 2026 due to divergent central bank policies between the Fed and the BoJ. The AUD/USD pair is expected to decline to 0.64 due to excessive RBA rate hike expectations and muted Chinese growth. The NZD/USD pair is predicted to be moderately bullish over 12 months due to booming dairy and meat exports, but the RBNZ's potential easing and more rate cuts are risks. USD/CAD is expected to remain rangebound."

      "summary": "The Outlook 2026 report predicts a bullish market environment for risky assets, including equities and bonds, with both long-term (3-6 months) and short-term (1-3 months) models indicating favorable conditions. The bullish equities view is based on constructive earnings revision and macro risk sentiment, low equity and moderate government bond market risks, and stable global inflation and growth rates. Factors supporting this view include positive equity momentum, net positive movements in interest rate benchmarks, and a disinflationary trend. Low government bond risk is attributed to soft private housing starts and manufacturing PMI, while strong equity gains and higher commodity prices make safe havens less attractive. Key model factors include economic activity, macro risk and surprise indices, corporate earnings, forward price-to-earnings ratio, technical factors, interest rates, commodity prices, and equity market momentum, among others."
